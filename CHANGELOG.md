### Special Thanks

* Thank you to @1011x, @jhaye, @lightdark, @maloki, @skrlet13, @melody, @stolas, @hak, @mecaka:
  those who've been helping with governance, offering advice, and/or been working on this for the
  past few months.
* Thank you to @woozle for hosting both the Wiki and Mattermost for us on their servers.
* Thank you to all the forkers out there who are providing us both with inspiration, actual code,
  and conversation about how we can make the Fediverse a little bit better.
* Thank you to everyone that has been cheerleading us for the past year, helped us have the courage
  to "Fork Off" from Mastodon, and also understood that we are working towards different
  objectives. That is after all why you all joined us in the first place!
* Thank you to @mecaka who joined the team while @maloki was getting diagnosed, who helped push
  through that time and bring us to where we are now.
* An additional thank you to those that joined the Mattermost server to keep the conversation alive
  with us after we moved on from Discord!
